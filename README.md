1. In my Recipe project development pipeline I'd fit my automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because of automation. It also projects my main branch from broken code.
2. No because E2E testing is for frontend/ui testing. In this case a function tests would not require E2E testing as I can use a unit test instead.
3. Navigation mode in Lighthouse analyzes a page right after its loads (interactivity not included). Snapshot mode in Lighthouse analyzes a page in its current state, proving useful to find accessibility issues.   
4. 3 things we can do to improve the cse110 shop website is.
  - Potentially save 518 KiB by properly sizing images
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) with load time of 1740ms - can update
  - potential saving of 120ms if we preload LCP
  - add a meta tag with width and initial scale info etc
